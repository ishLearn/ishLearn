This contains the code to the web-DB project.

## DB

- MySQL

## Backend

- Logging with `chalk@4.1.2`

### Additional information:

Chalk version `5.0.0` introduced ECMAScript modules with chalk and ended support of CommonJS-modules. Since TS with `type: module` in the `package.json` did not work and fixes are very hard, and there is no compiler for node modules in use, the older version (compatible to `4.1.2`) is required. (More information on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70309135/chalk-error-err-require-esm-require-of-es-module))
